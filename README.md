# Spectral Neural Networks for automatic input feature relevance estimation

In this repository is stored the code and the data of the paper "Automatic Input Feature Relevance via Spectral Neural Networks".

There are three distinct notebooks, one for each dataset considered in this work. Each notebook contains the code for model definition, dataset generation, model training, and result plotting.
